    " **Routing in LangChain Expression Language**:\n",
    "  - The concept of routing is explored in LangChain Expression Language, allowing for the creation of non-deterministic chains.\n",
    "  - In these chains, the output of one step determines the subsequent step, providing a structured and consistent approach to interactions with LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Methods for Implementing Routing**:\n",
    "  1. **Using RunnableBranch**: This method involves utilizing a `RunnableBranch` for routing purposes.\n",
    "  2. **Custom Factory Function**: Alternatively, routing can be achieved by writing a custom factory function. This function should take the output of a previous step and return a runnable without executing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Practical Example of Routing**:\n",
    "  - An example showcases a two-step sequence:\n",
    "    - The first step involves classifying an input question as related to LangChain, Anthropic, or Other.\n",
    "    - Based on this classification, the sequence is then routed to a corresponding prompt chain tailored to the identified category.\n"

    "**Concept of RunnableBranch in LangChain**:\n",
    "  - A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of pairs, each consisting of a condition and a corresponding runnable, along with a default runnable.\n",
    "  - The selection of the branch is based on evaluating each condition with the given input.\n",
    "  - The first condition that evaluates to True triggers the execution of its associated runnable.\n",

    "**Chain Creation and Functionality**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Different types of chains (Classification, LangChain, Anthropic, General) were created using `PromptTemplate`, `ChatOpenAI`, and `StrOutputParser`.\n",
    "- Each chain is designed to handle specific types of questions or topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Branching Logic with RunnableBranch**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `RunnableBranch` uses lambda functions to route input to the appropriate chain based on topic classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Full Chain Composition and Invocation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `full_chain` combines the classification chain with branching logic.\n",
    "- The `invoke` method is used to pass a question to the chain for processing and response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simplification with RunnablePassthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `RunnablePassthrough` was suggested to streamline the chain by passing the entire input dictionary directly to the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Role of Lambda Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lambda functions act like callback functions, executing at the right moment in the chainâ€™s execution to process input.\n",
    "- They are necessary for dynamic handling of input within the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Passing Dictionaries in LangChain**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In LangChain chains, dictionaries are used to pass data between different components of the chain. Each component may modify or add to this dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function of Lambda Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lambda functions (`lambda x: ...`) are used to manipulate or access data within these dictionaries. They act as callback functions, executed at specific points in the chain.\n",
    "- For example, `lambda x: x[\"question\"]` extracts the `\"question\"` value from the input dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use of RunnablePassthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `RunnablePassthrough` is a simplification tool that forwards the entire input dictionary to the next component without any modification.\n",
    "- It's useful when the entire context needs to be passed along the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Invoking Chains with Dictionaries**\n",
    "\n",
    "- When invoking a chain (e.g., `full_chain.invoke(...)`), the input is typically a dictionary (e.g., `{\"question\": \"how do i use langchain?\"}`).\n",
    "- This dictionary becomes the input for the first component of the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Branching Logic and Dictionary Access**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In branching logic (like `RunnableBranch`), lambda functions check specific keys (like `\"topic\"`) in the input dictionary to decide the flow of execution.\n",
    "- The dictionary structure allows for flexible and dynamic handling of input based on the conditions defined in these lambda functions.\n"
